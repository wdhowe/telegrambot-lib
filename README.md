A Clojure library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.

The goal of this library is to be a complete implementation of the Telegram Bot API in Clojure,
without adding extra bot logic.

Each API call is a Clojure function, with docstrings outlining required and optional parameters.

> **For more information on updates to the Telegram Bot API version, see the [Releases](https://github.com/wdhowe/telegrambot-lib/releases).**
