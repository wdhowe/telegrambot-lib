# telegrambot-lib

[![Build Status][gh-actions-badge]][gh-actions] [![Clojars Project][clojars-badge]][clojars] [![Clojure Docs][cljdoc-badge]][cljdoc-link] [![Clojure version][clojure-v]](project.clj)

A Clojure library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.

Implemented Telegram functions accurate as of [Bot API 5.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#november-4-2020)

## Usage

Get started using the telegrambot-lib.

### Installation

Leiningen/Boot Project file

```clojure
[telegrambot-lib "0.3.0"]
```

### Include the Library

In the REPL

```clojure
(require '[telegrambot-lib.core :as tbot])
```

In your application

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [telegrambot-lib.core :as tbot]))
```

### Use the Library

Pre-Reqs:

- You have [created a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) and received an auth token.
- The library is installed/included as indicated above.
- Examples below assume ":as tbot" was followed in require command.

The bot api auth token can be given to the bot instance by either:

- Environment variable
- Function parameter

#### Create a bot - with a token env var

This method looks for "bot-token" or "BOT_TOKEN" from the environment.

```clojure
(def mybot (tbot/create))
```

#### Create a bot - with a token parameter

This method requires passing the token as a parameter at creation time.

```clojure
(def mybot (tbot/create my-token))
```

#### Verify a working bot

Verify your bot instance is working with the "get-me" function.

```clojure
(tbot/get-me mybot)

;; returns something like this
{:ok true,
 :result
 {:id 123,
  :is_bot true,
  :first_name "mybot",
  :username "my_roboto",
  :can_join_groups true,
  :can_read_all_group_messages false,
  :supports_inline_queries false}}
```

## Available Functions

Current [ClojureDocs documentation is here][cljdoc-link].

All of the Telegram Bot API functions in this library are imported into the telegrambot-lib.core namespace.

This makes them available by their non-namespaced names and are all listed within the "import-vars" function (in telegram-lib.core).

### Generic Function Call

Additionally, there is a generic 'call' function that may be used to send a request to any endpoint if the function does not exist yet.

```clojure
;; generic call example
(tbot/call mybot "getMe")

;; generic call example with content
(tbot/call mybot "sendMessage" {:chat_id 789 :text "Hello Bot World!"})
```

## Sending/Receiving Content

Most functions are multi-arity with the following options:

- Send all parameters in a 'content' map.
- Send only the required parameters as simple values.
- Send the required paraemters as simple values and then 'optional' parameters in a map.

Required parameters are named to match the Telegram API, so they should be self explanatory in most cases.

Refer to the function docstrings or the [Telegram Bot API Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for optional parameter content.

See the below 'How to send a chat message' section for examples on the different ways to pass parameters.

## How to send a chat message

- In the Telegram client: Add your bot to a channel or message it directly.
- From your app/repl: Have your bot get updates.
  - Recent chat messages on the server are returned, along with the chat id of the sender(s).
  - In this case, the sender is (from id) is the same as the chat id. (ie: this is a private direct message)

```clojure
;; some functions, such as get-updates only take the bot (this) as a parameter
(tbot/get-updates mybot)

;; response - parsed into a Clojure map
{:ok true, :result [{:update_id 761420707, :message {:message_id 9, :from {:id 789, :is_bot false, :first_name "Bill", :last_name "Howe", :username "myusername", :language_code "en"}, :chat {:id 789, :first_name "Bill", :last_name "Howe", :username "myusername", :type "private"}, :date 1602815917, :text "oh hi"}}]}
```

- Send your message to the target chat id.
  - Notice the incrementing message_id number. This is useful to keep track of message order and which messages have already been processed.

```clojure
;; Option 1: send all 'content' as a map
(tbot/send-message mybot {:chat_id 789 :text "oh hi yourself."})

;; Option 2: send only required parameters as simple values
(tbot/send-message mybot 789 "oh hi yourself.")

;; Option 3: send required parameters as simple values, optional values as a map
(tbot/send-message mybot 789 "oh hi yourself." {:disable_notification true})

;; response - parsed into a Clojure map
{:ok true, :result {:message_id 10, :from {:id 123, :is_bot true, :first_name "mybot", :username "my_roboto"}, :chat {:id 789, :first_name "Bill", :last_name "Howe", :username "myusername", :type "private"}, :date 1602816282, :text "oh hi yourself."}}
```
