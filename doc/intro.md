# Introduction to telegrambot-lib

The goal of this library is to be a complete implementation of the Telegram Bot
API in Clojure, without adding extra bot logic.

Each Bot API call is implemented in a Clojure function, with docstrings
outlining required and optional parameters.

This allows for minimal reference to the Telegram documentation and staying in the editor.

Focus on writing your bot and leave the API call handling to this library.
